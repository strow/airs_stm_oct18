* Overview

A Hyperspectral IR Climate Record Depends on Sensor Continuity

- Spectral :: Large differences between AIRS, CrIS, IASI
- Radiometric :: Differences in the 0.3K or less range, which is a great starting point.
- Spatial :: AIRS footprint slightly smeared relative to CrIS, slight impact on extrema


We explore here the differences between AIRS, SNPP CrIS, and NOAA20 CrIS

\vspace{0.1in}

Results for NOAA20 CrIS (J1) are /preliminary/.  Calibration of NOAA20 will likely be updated in the July time-frame.


* *Spectral*

- Wednesday's presentation focused on AIRS2CrIS algorithm/product.
- Emphasize that we need AIRS L1c product at the DAAC for production of AIRS2CrIS products.
- Present approach: standardize on CrIS normal spectral resolution (NSR) for radiometric climate record.
- Conversion of IASI2CrIS is essentially trivial since IASI L1c gaussian apodization is far from zero at 0.8 cm path difference, so conversion to 0.8 sinc ILS is robust.

* *Radiometric*

- Do we need to have similar noise levels for AIRS2CrIS and CrIS if used for Level 2 retrievals?  Should that be incorporated into a AIRS2CrIS product?

- Use a combination of SNOs and large statistical inter-comparisons to determine radiometric differences between sensors, but they agree quite well.  This is important!

- SNOs are heavily weighted to high latitudes.  

- Large statistical inter-comparisons allow examination of scene dependence differences among sensors, better statistics.

- We will attempt to model this and fix by changing AIRS ILS functions (including entrance filter fringe positions)

* CrIS - AIRS Summary

Determine if AIRS ILS functions need adjustment:

- First, apply exact \nu calibration to L1c (easy, just didn't do it)
- ~8 \wn "fringes" in CrIS-AIRS.  Entrance filter fringe shifts?
- Try ILS changes that are within estimated TVAC errors
- Then, apply as offsets in AIRS2CRIS
- \textcolor{maroon}{Testing does NOT require RTA calculations!}  AIRS ILS functions embedded in AIRS2CrIS algorithm.

Test via Linear trends computed two ways:
    1. dB(T)/dt AIRS2CrIS (10-year set)
    2. dB(T)/dt AIRS2CrIS: 5 years + CrIS: next 5 years

- /Preliminary/: NOAA20 non-linearity estimation done quickly
- Will be updated in July
- AIRS SNOs versus SNPP/NOAA20 CrIS are *invaluable*, since direct SNOs don't really exist except at very high latitudes

- AIRS2CrIS used CrIS FSR, so shortwave bad, but "OK" for large averages in window regions
- Slight remnants of bad AIRS channels?
- Averaging over 9 FOVs for both CrIS's
- Scene dependence may help separate ICT diffs from non-linearity (same ICT temperature for both CrIS's)

- CrIS hotter at high B(T): better scene is larger sample (SNPP vs AIRS)
- SNPP vs NOAAA20 roughly within statistical error bounds

* Look for CrIS Non-Linearity

\small
- Non-linearity higher in extreme longwave, examine 700 \wn B(T)
- B(T) 900 \wn reasonable proxy for integrated detector signal
- SNPP, NOAA20 CrIS's /are/ different!

* Radiometric Differences: Conclusions

- We are looking at very small radiometric differences between all instruments
- Instruments all appear very stable, so these differences can be account for
- If we have enough overlap (true so far) the uncertainty in instrument differences is /very/ small, maybe <0.03K?
- Over 5-years that is <0.01K.

* *Spatial*

H. Aumann: standard deviation between adjacent CrIS scenes is 12% larger than between AIRS adjacent scenes.  

- Maybe be very relevant for cloud-clearing.  C. Barnet and A. Gambacorta verify larger CC yield for CrIS.
- What does this mean for Level 3 sampling differences between AIRS and CrIS?
- AIRS2CrIS won't fix this.  Should be relatively unimportant for single-footprint retrievals.

We examine statistical differences between SNPP-CrIS and AIRS as a function of scene temperature to look for spatial effects.

- Absolute peak of difference near 296.5K is -3%
- AIRS sees more cold scenes until about 240K
- Then as high clouds get smaller? CrIS sees more scenes?
- Below 220K, AIRS has more scenes?  Radiometric?
- Smearing of 0.2 no good below ~220K
